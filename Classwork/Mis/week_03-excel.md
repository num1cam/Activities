# Class Project Week 3: Data Preparation with Excel for Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Analysis

## Introduction to Data Preparation

Data preparation is a foundational step in the data analytics process. Before analysis can begin, it's crucial that our data is in the right shape, free of errors, and structured in a way that makes analysis straightforward and meaningful. This step often involves:

- Cleaning the data by handling missing values and errors.
- Structuring the data into organized tables, rows, and columns.
- Aggregating and summarizing data to get an overview.
- Visualizing data to find patterns and insights.

Microsoft Excel is a versatile tool that offers a plethora of functionalities for data preparation. This week, we'll delve into some of Excel's core features that make data preparation efficient and intuitive.

## Activity: Data Ingestion in Excel

**Dataset Distribution**: 
We'll start with a simpler dataset to get our feet wet - the **Electric Vehicle Sales Data**. This dataset is expected to contain time-series data, sales figures, and possibly other related information, making it a good starting point for beginners.

**Data Familiarization**: 
Open the dataset in Excel and familiarize yourself with its structure. Navigate through the rows and columns, identify data types, and keep an eye out for any missing or anomalous data.

**Creating Tables**: 
Excel tables are a powerful tool that can help structure your data better. Convert the dataset into an Excel table. Doing so will give you benefits like easy sorting, filtering, and a more structured view of your data.

## Activity 2: Basic Data Visualization in Excel

**Graphical Analysis**: 
Visualization often provides insights that raw data might not. Using the EV Sales Data, create basic visualizations:

- Line graphs to visualize sales trends over time.
- Bar graphs to compare sales by different categories, such as model or region.

**Interpretation**: 
After creating these visualizations, let's take a step back. What do these graphs tell us? Engage in a discussion about the insights you can glean from these visualizations. What does the data reveal about the EV market's growth, popular models, or regional preferences?

## Activity 3: Aggregation using Pivot Tables

**Pivot Table Creation**: 
Pivot tables are one of Excel's most powerful features, allowing for quick data summarization and aggregation. Using the same dataset:

- Create pivot tables to see sales aggregated by different dimensions like year, region, or model.
- Explore different values in the pivot table, such as total sales, average sales, or the number of entries.

**Data Summarization**: 
Pivot tables come with their in-built functions. Learn how to use functions within pivot tables to get a summarized view of the data. Functions like SUM, AVERAGE, and COUNT can provide quick insights into the dataset's nature and trends.

At the end of this week, you'll have a strong foundational understanding of Excel's capabilities in data ingestion, visualization, and summarization. These skills will be instrumental as we move forward with our project and delve deeper into data analytics.
